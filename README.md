This is the final submission made by myself and Kevin Luo for COMP3231 2017s1 asst2.

The assignment was to implement the file system for OS161. Primarily keeping track of open files and designing the method for 
processes to keep track of their open files. Most important code is found in kern/syscall/file.c.

Read design.txt for more information about the design process and other files that were modified for the assignment.
